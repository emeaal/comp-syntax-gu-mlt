- Whenever I have saved something new in my Swedish gf files I get the following "error" message: 
    " 
    Happened in linearization of wait_V2
      Warning: ignoring lock fields in resolving mkV2 (mkV "vänta") "på"
               for
                 V Str
               using
                 {s : VForm => Str} Str
    "
This applies for all transitive verbs (V2) and everything still works regardless of it. I remember I had the same problem back in June and a few other students did as well. We asked Arianna about it but couldn't find a solution to make these messages go away. Everything seems to work fine even if I'm getting them so I decided to not put too much effort into finding a solution for making them go away, even though they annoy me at times.

- Adverbs are sometimes repeated in random generated sentences. For example this works when two different adverbs are randomly chosen e.g "han sover redan nu" but sometimes the same word is chosen and therefore repeated twice e.g "han sover nu nu" or "han sover redan redan". Since this was also the case when I compared my grammar using the functor I decided to keep it this way too but there is hopefully a solution to this that I couldn't find at the moment.

- When testing my grammar using the functor most things that differ from the functor are just the different translations of words. For example "river" is translated into "å" in the functor but I chose to translate it to "flod", "good" was translated into "god" but I translated it to "bra". "find" = "hitta" / "finna"

- "slå sönder" vs "bryta"  ("vänta på")
